Quark Matter in Neutron Stars

This program was developed as part of a paper on the presence of quark matter inside neutron stars.

It begins by diagonalizing a matrix with derivative-based techniques, which is essential for analyzing system instabilities.

Solves coupled differential equations that describe stellar structure.

Applies a frequentist statistical analysis to estimate the parameters that best fit the model.

Determines the last stable configuration of the star through instability diagonalization.

Beyond Astrophysics

Although designed for astrophysical research, the same methodology extends to business and industry:

Matrix diagonalization & stability checks → identifying systemic vulnerabilities in finance, logistics, or operations.

Dynamic modeling (differential equations) → describing supply chains, customer flows, or financial dynamics.

Frequentist parameter estimation → extracting the best-fit market trends, risk levels, or customer behaviors from observed data.

In short, the same tools used here to explore the stability of neutron stars can be applied to optimize strategies, validate models, and anticipate critical transitions in business contexts.
